# Understanding Neural Networks
A Simplified Analogy
           Imagine a neural network as a team of workers, each with a specific task. The input layer receives raw data (like images or text) and passes it to the hidden layers. These hidden layers process the data, identifying patterns and features. Finally, the output layer produces the result, such as a classification or a prediction.

Key Concepts
## Types of Neural Networks

* Feedforward Neural Networks: Information flows in a single direction, from input to output.
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized for image and video analysis.
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Designed for sequential data, like text and time series.
* Training Neural Networks

     *  Supervised Learning: The model learns from labeled data.
     *  Unsupervised Learning: The model learns patterns from unlabeled data.
## Tokenization and Parameters

To make data digestible for neural networks, we break it down into smaller pieces called tokens. These tokens can be words, parts of words, or even individual pixels.

=> Neural networks learn by adjusting their internal parameters:

* Weights: Determine the importance of input features.
* Biases: Shift the output of a neuron.
* Learning Rate: Controls the speed of learning.
* Activation Functions: Introduce non-linearity.
* Kernel Size: Defines the size of the filter in convolutional layers.
